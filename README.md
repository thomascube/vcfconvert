#### Note from Kevin on libdlusb compatibility
Due to the fact libdlusb is incapable of transmitting all the information
generally used with the contact application (currently it is capable of 
only transmitting name, type, and phone number) I have intentionally organized
the format to be convenient for saving into the note application instead. This 
allows the user to have multiple phone numbers per entry along with an e-mail
address.
